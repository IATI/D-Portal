d-portal.org Feedback

#feedback_paragraph1_text
Hello, all and thank you for taking part as beta testers for d-portal.org. We welcome any and all feedback, suggestions and concerns you may have about the website so please feel free to post them as comments below. Overall, we want to focus on legibility and user experience, especially in terms of understanding the data that is being presented.

#feedback_paragraph2_text
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this! We hope to create something useful and easily deployable, an interesting talking point but most importantly, promote better data quality from reporting organisations.

About d-portal.org

#about_paragraph_title_text
What is it?

#about_paragraph1_text
d-portal.org is a country-based information platform that tracks resource flows.

#about_paragraph2_text
It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.

#about_paragraph3_text
In its first iteration it contains current data published through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent (2012) data published by the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/crsguide.htm" target="_blank" class="co">OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System</a>. 

#about_paragraph4_text
The current platform poses two questions: where do resources come from, and where do they go (by sector and location)? Recent, current and future data is presented and compared across data sources. 

#about_paragraph5_text
In order to answer these questions from a country perspective it is insufficient merely to display available data: it is equally important to plot the gaps in the information. Coping with poor quality or missing data is an essential part of the information interface. 

#about_paragraph6_text
is an open source platform.

#about_paragraph7_text
While it currently provides a generic deployment for any country it has been developed with the specific intention of being customised in-country to meet local needs. For further information on how you could create a customised version for a specific country, see <a href="#install" class="how">How to Install</a>.

#about_paragraph8_text
Funding

#about_paragraph9_text

#about_paragraph10_text

#savi_paragraph1_text
SAVi is a simple activity viewer for IATI XML that you can view in real time, online, in your favourite browser.

#savi_paragraph2_text
SAVi uses CSS and javascript to display otherwise complex-looking XML into a format that is easier to read and digest.

#dstore_paragraph_text
dstore subsidizes the IATI Datastore with an optimized nodejs + SQLite version for use in real time queries.

#q_paragraph_text
Q allows you to query information you need via simple but complex filters.

How to install d-portal <i>(coming soon)</i>

#install_paragraph1_text
At the heart of the d-portal project is the aim that anyone anywhere could take the open source code behind d-portal, deploy it for themselves and create a customised d-portal for any country that interests them.  This could include adding any other data from Aid Information Management Systems, national budgets and a range of comparable socio-economic indicators.

#install_paragraph2_text
There are already examples of customised country-specific d-portals like 

#install_paragraph3_text
The final product will be available as a set of HTML, Javascript, and CSS files.

#install_paragraph4_text
Since HTML, CSS, Javascript are the technologies of the web, and are widely used and understood, we believe this is a good option for easy adoption by others, for easy deployment, and for easy re-configuration and customisation.

Dash: Publishers statistics for d-portal.org

#dash_paragraph1_text
Dash is an overview of the data populating d-portal.org with a focus primarily on publisher statistics and the quality of the data reported by them.

#dash_paragraph2_text
By showing you when and where invalid data is reported, Dash will be able to explain the gaps that are reflected on the main site.

#dash_paragraph3_text
Dash is not country specific so you will be able to view all of the publisher statistics available across all countries included in the portal. This is to accomodate the fact that there are multiple publishers that report activities in multiple recipient countries.

#dash_paragraph4_text
Dash is currently accessible at <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash" class="dash_link">http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?#view=dash</a>. Dash is a new feature and is still being developed.
