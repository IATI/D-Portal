We've been quite busy at d-portal. There have been a few changes since 
the last news post, so here is a quick rundown of things added since 
December.

**New features**

<img 
src="{_dirname}/trans_graph.png" 
alt="Simple graph showing the different type of transactions" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 1._** *New addition to the transaction table - groupings and graphs*

Transactions are now grouped by type in SAVi (<a 
href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/379">#379</a>). This 
should make it easier to quickly look through the otherwise, unwieldy 
list. By doing this, we're able to add simple graphs for each 
transaction type.

The main graph will collectively display all transaction types reported 
within the activity and individual graphs will be displayed below each 
section.

Transactions are merged if they are published for the same date and 
we're only showing graphs for transactions that have been published 
using the same currency.


<img 
src="{_dirname}/country_graph.png" 
alt="Country bar graphs" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 2._** *Country bar graph*

We've replaced the Sector and Country pie charts with more useful bar 
graphs. The previous Google graphs are fully deprecated with some pages 
not showing them at all even when data is present.

<img 
src="{_dirname}/sector_graph.png" 
alt="Sector bar graphs" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 3._** *Sector bar graph*

It should now be easier to see the data in relation to percentages. 
We're also displaying the 2-digit country codes and sector codes.


**Add Sectors to map csv download** (<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/480">#480</a>)

<img 
src="{_dirname}/sector_csv.png" 
alt="Sector data in spreadsheet download" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 4._** *Sector data in csv download*

CSV data downloads now include both sectors and sector groups (DAC 5 
and 3 Digit codes) as columns.

At present, the downloaded data does not reflect what you see on the 
map page so we are very keen to devote more time to creating a proper 
interface to access such data, but this will take some time. As such, 
it would be good to know if we should prioritise such a thing.

If you would like to see this developed, let us know <a 
href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/409">here</a>.


**Display humanitarian in transactions** (<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/501">#501</a>)

<img 
src="{_dirname}/human00.png" 
alt="Activity that relates to humanitarian aid will be displayed with a flag" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 5._** *Humanitarian flag displayed on SAVi (Simple Activity Viewer)*

For activities reported using iati-activity/@humanitarian, ie. the 
entire activity relates to humanitarian aid, we're displaying a 
humanitarian flag in the activity viewer.

<img 
src="{_dirname}/human01.png" 
alt="Humanitarian flag within transactions" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 6._** *Displaying humanitarian flag at transaction level*

At transaction level, the flag is displayed within the transaction 
tables.

According to the standard, reporting @humanitarian at transaction level 
does not indicate that the entire activity is related to humanitarian 
aid. Therefore, the display here will differ.


**Display 'Withdrawn' for withdrawn Sectors in search dropdown** (<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/455">#455</a>)

<img 
src="{_dirname}/withdrawn00_andy.png" 
alt="Dropdown stylings for withdrawn codes" width="720" height="359">
<img 
src="{_dirname}/withdrawn01.png" 
alt="Withdrawn codes in SAVi" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 7._** *Withdrawn codes in search dropdown (Image by Andy Lulham) and in sector graph*

Withdrawn codes are now styled differently in the search dropdown to 
make it easier to differentiate them.

Withdrawn sector codes are also displayed accordingly in the new graphs.


**Add and display ref attribute** (<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/417">#417</a>)

<img 
src="{_dirname}/ref.png" 
alt="Adding ref attribute to the list" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 8._** *Displaying organisation references*

With the addition of displaying the @ref attribute, the 
participating-org list looks to be getting longer and longer. This is a 
first step in showing as much data as is published in an activity - 
we'll be looking at making this section more manageable in the near 
future.

**Display organisation-type for provider and receiver** (<a href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/475">#475</a>)

<img 
src="{_dirname}/org_type_ref.png" 
alt="Displaying organisation type" width="720" height="359">
**_Figure 9._** *Displaying type and references at transaction level*

Organisation type and references are useful information to see in the 
context of an activity. These attributes are now displayed at 
transaction and planned disbursement levels when they are reported.
