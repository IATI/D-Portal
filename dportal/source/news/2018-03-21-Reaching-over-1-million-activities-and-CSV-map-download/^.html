D-portal has <a

million activities</a> in the database.

**_Figure 2._** *Early January with 784540 activities*

This is a huge difference when compared to <a 
href="https://xriss.github.io/D-Portal-Logs/">785,000 at the beginning 
of the year</a> and we expect this number to increase as the months go 
by.


**CSV map download**

We’ve added the ability for you to download csv data with coordinates 
(<i>as well as other relevant fields</i>). This data can also be further 
filtered by using the dropdown; ie. choosing ‘Active’ will only 
download ‘Active’ activities.

**This new feature can be found on the map views of individual portals.**

IATI is continually working on more ways to ensure people can access 
the data they want through d-portal. Please share any comments or 
suggestions via <a 
href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal">GitHub</a> or email <a 
href="mailto:support@iatistandard.org?subject=Regarding%20d-portal.org">support@iatistandard.org</a>. 
With your help, we can make d-portal better.
