#donors_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donors_data_description_text
This table shows external resource flows being used in development: past, present and future.  All cells should contain data and the fact that many don't is a problem with the quality of available data. The columns display the following data:

#donors_data_title1_text
CRS

#donors_data_info1_text
All members of the OECD and a number of other countries and institutions report annually to the <span class="bold italic">OECD Creditor Reporting System</span> on Official Development Assistance and other official flows. This data is published retrospectively: usually in December of each year the CRS is updated with data from the previous year (so is between 12 and 23 months out of date). While backward-looking data is not particularly helpful for development planning - it is a very useful and relatively accurate point of reference. It is particularly useful for including place holders for countries and institutions that currently do not report to IATI. The data provided in this column is the annual total disbursements (spend) for the donor. The values are in current US dollars. "-" indicate that there is no CRS data for that donor.

#donors_data_title2_text
DONOR

#donors_data_info2_text
The agency (which can be a donor or an implementing organisation) reporting data to IATI and/or CRS. Clicking on this cell will take you to a list of all activities reported to IATI by this agency. This table is ordered by the value of 2016 IATI data, but can be re-sorted by clicking on the relevant year at the top of the table.

Agencies are grouped for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jpXHDNmJ1WPdrkidEle0Ig13zLlXw4eV6WkbSy6kWk4/edit#gid=4">CRS</a>.

#donors_data_title3_text
IATI SPEND

#donors_data_info3_text
Three columns containing total disbursements and expenditure reported to IATI for the current and previous two years. The first column will always be the same year as the most recent CRS data, enabling comparisons between the two. Clicking on any cell will take you to a list of projects that make up the value in the cell (listed in order of their contribution to that value). Cells containing "-" indicate that the organisation has not yet published to IATI. Cells containing "0" are an indication of issues with quality of data reported to IATI.

#donors_data_title4_text
IATI BUDGET

#donors_data_info4_text
Total activity-level budgets for this and next year reported to IATI. Clicking on any cell will take you to a list of projects that make up the value in the cell (listed in order of their contribution to that value). Cells containing "-" indicate that the organisation has not yet published to IATI. Cells containing "0" are an indication of issues with quality of data reported to IATI.

#donor_activities_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_activities_data_description_text
Spend is calculated by adding disbursements and expenditures. This list shows you total commitments for each activity and the percentage spent so far, sorted by biggest at the top. Full black bars may signify data quality issues where published data is missing commitment and/or transaction information.

#donor_transactions_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_transactions_data_description_text
Spend is calculated by adding disbursements and expenditures. This list shows you all activities reported and sorted by the activity with the highest spend at the top.

#donor_budgets_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_budgets_data_description_text
Budget is calculated by adding up every budget that is less than 370 days long and ends in {year}. This list shows you all this {donor}'s activities that have budgets for {year} sorted by biggest at the top. Zeroes suggest discrepancies in that calculation due to insufficient data and signify data quality issues.

#sectors_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#sectors_data_description_text
This table shows the sectors to which external development resource flows are being channelled: past, present and future.  The columns display the following data:

#sectors_data_title1_text

#data_title_text
Why data quality matters

#data_paragraph1_text
Most of the data currently available in d-portal comes from IATI publishers: over 500 organisations who are publishing their development activities in IATI-XML format. This data is published on their own websites and indexed on IATI's Registry. On a nightly basis IATI polls all data indexed on the registry and saves the latest version of each published activity in a central Datastore. The Datastore is therefore not a curated database, but a compilation of all IATI data as of last night.

#data_paragraph2_text
The IATI standard is flexible in its reporting rules to allow as many different organisations with varying capacity to publish their data in this common format. The philosophy is for organisations to start publishing what they can and improve the quality of their data over time. This means that there will always be data of varying quality available through IATI.

#data_paragraph3_text
However, IATI was established to meet the needs of developing countries, who have consistently asked for timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information that can be used in the planning and monitoring of development. A <a href="http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Paper-4a-Country-Survey-of-AIMS.pdf" target="_blank" title="Links to a PDF in new window">recent survey</a> conducted by IATI reinforced these demands. IATI's ask is therefore that publishers update their data at least quarterly; that the latest data is not more than three months out of date; and that forward-looking activity-level budgets are provided for at least one year in advance.

#data_paragraph4_text
d-portal showcases the best practice of a number of major development partners. Many IATI publishers, however, are currently <span class="underline">not</span> meeting what developing countries have clearly indicated are their minimum requirements. This just isn't good enough.

#data_paragraph5_text
When we started to develop <span class="bold italic">d-portal</span> we thought our task was just to showcase all IATI data. We soon realised that from a country point of view this was of limited use: it is just as important to show where data is missing as to show where it is present. In various tables you will see cells containing "0" : these indicate areas where IATI publishers are failing to provide any data, or are provide low quality which can not currently be shown in d-portal. You will also see cells containing "-": these indicate organisations who are not yet publishing any data to IATI.

#data_paragraph6_text
We hope that our presentation of the data - and the current gaps - provides a useful overview of the data landscape. Where there are critical holes in the data we would encourage you to engage with your development partners to demand that they improve the quality of data that they currently make available.
