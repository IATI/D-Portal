How is the data calculated?

#donors_data_description_text
d-portal.org is a country-based information platform that tracks resource flows. It is aimed at providing line ministries, parliamentarians and civil society with information that can assist with the planning and monitoring of development activities.
In its first iteration it contains current data published through the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) as well as the most recent (2012) data published by the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System. Future development will include, inter alia, data from Aid Information Management Systems, national budgets and a range of comparable socio-economic indicators.

#donor_activities_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_activities_data_description_text
Spend is calculated by adding disbursements and expenditures. This table shows you total commitments for each activity and the percentage spent so far, sorted by biggest at the top. Black bars signify data quality issues where published data is missing commitment and/or transaction information.

#donor_transactions_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_transactions_data_description_text
Spend is calculated by adding disbursements and expenditures. This table shows you all activities reported by {donor} for {country_name} and sorted by the activity with the highest spend at the top.

#donor_budgets_data_description_title_text
How is the data calculated?

#donor_budgets_data_description_text
Budget is calculated by adding up every budget that is less than 370 days long and ends in {year}. This table shows you all activities that have listed budgets for {year} sorted by biggest at the top. Zeros in tables suggest discrepancies in that calculation due to insufficient data and signify data quality issues.

Why data quality matters

#data_paragraph1_text
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.

#data_paragraph2_text
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

#data_paragraph3_text
It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, the brain stem,  the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons with phase discriminators.

#data_paragraph4_text
Deflector power at maximum. Energy discharge in six seconds. Warp reactor core primary coolant failure. Fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Resistance is futile. Recommend we adjust shield harmonics to the upper EM band when proceeding. These appear to be some kind of power-wave-guide conduits which allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. Increase deflector modulation to upper frequency band.

#data_paragraph5_text
Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems. Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace frequencies.

#data_paragraph6_text
Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.

#data_paragraph7_text
Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.

#data_paragraph8_text
Resistance is futile.
