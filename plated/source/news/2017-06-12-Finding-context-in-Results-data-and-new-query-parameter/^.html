Results data heirarchy is not particularly verbose.

*Fig. 1 - The results element heirarchy*


At its most basic, there is a title, description and an indicator. The 
indicator makes up most of the results element with links to reference 
documents, a baseline and the all important period element. Here in the 
period element will contain the start and end dates, target and actual 
values and within those, location and dimensions data like sex, gender 
and age. Dimensions data is freetext so there are no restrictions to 
what a publisher can well, publish. Due to this, data within this 
element might be difficult to aggregate.

There are also multiple narrative and comment elements within the 
results subelements. We found that publishers tend to repeat themselves 
rather than add new information in these sections.

SAVi displays complex-looking IATI XML (the elements found in a single 
activity) in a format that is hopefully, easier to read and digest. To 
achieve this, we try to understand the context of the data being used 
and how best to lay it out so that it makes the most sense to the 
casual user. Thus far, we're only showing the most commonly used 
elements of the IATI schema, which means there are still parts of the 
XML hidden from view on SAVi pages. This doesn't mean we've changed the 
original XML in any shape or form (you still have access to this via 
the xml link on each SAVi page) but it does mean there are still many 
parts of the iati-activity element that we've not fully understood or 
explored. Hopefully, as more elements get adopted by publishers, we'll 
get the opportunity to delve deeper into use cases that are in demand.

When we were <a 
href="https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/issues/179">first asked to 
display results data in SAVi</a>, we misunderstood it entirely! Without 
context or how and what it was used for, a structure to compose a 
visual layout was at most, based on assumptions.

*Fig. 2 - First iteration of results data saw a rudimentary layout without 
baseline data*


The first thing we had to do was find some actual results data to work 
with. Preferably an activity with most of the results subelement 
completed; this seemed a harder feat than we thought.

I visited the <a 
href="http://dashboard.iatistandard.org/element/iati-activity_result.html">IATI 
Dashboard</a> to point me in the right direction. The dashboard has 
been really useful in terms of finding publishers using certain 
elements, especially so for SAVi as we're always trying to visualise 
certain sections of an activity and this always meant looking for 
example data. The only thing I wish the dashboard would do was display 
the full publisher name or even their reporting-org id instead of their 
IATI Registry id as that would not only save me one more step 
(currently, I have to click on the publisher link to find out the 
actual publisher name) but it would be consistent with other parts of 
the dashboard website where the full publisher names are displayed.

In any case, there was still a lot to do after this to find an activity 
that has a high completion of the result subelements. This prompted us 
to add a **new query parameter to Q which is live right now on 
d-portal**. Give it a go!


<code><a href="http://d-portal.org/q.json?from=element&orderby=element_volume-&limit=10&element_name0=result">http://d-portal.org/q.json?from=element&orderby=element_volume-&limit=10&element_name0=result</a></code>

The above query will display the top 10 activities that contain the 
'result' element in descending order of frequency as JSON. Replace 
**.json** with **.html**, **.xml** or **.csv** if you prefer.


The query is 4 levels deep, this is enough to reach the deepest part of 
the IATI standard. For example, if I want to search for activities that 
have dimension data within the target element of results data, my query 
will look like this:


<code><a href="http://d-portal.org/q.json?from=element&orderby=element_volume-&limit=10&element_name0=dimension&element_name1=target&element_name2=period&element_name3=indicator">http://d-portal.org/q.json?from=element&orderby=element_volume-&limit=10&element_name0=dimension&element_name1=target&element_name2=period&element_name3=indicator</a></code>

As you can see, the query starts with the innermost element and you'll 
need to list the hierarchy as it appears <a 
href="http://iatistandard.org/202/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/">in 
the standard</a>.

We started going down the route of deeper searches into attributes but 
this is a rather resource hungry option so we've taken it out for now. 
If there are demands for such things in the future, do let us know.


During the four-day <a 
href="http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/open-ag-funding-action-tools-tackle-hunger/">Open 
Ag Tool workshop</a>, we met experts in the field who gave us guidance 
on approaching results data. Nadeja Mandrescu from Development Gateway 
not only shared how results data was published and how baseline was 
calculated, she also explained how different publishers had different 
approaches to publishing this data - Yearly, Quarterly etc. This gave 
us some context and a brief overview of the rather complex nature of 
the results data element.

*Fig. 3 - WIP iteration of results data with two columns made the baseline look 
out of place*


We were later approached by Andy Lulham from Publish What You Fund 
about the way we visualised baseline data (or rather, the lack of it)! 
He pointed out the importance of baseline data, how it provided context 
for the target and actual elements and how it would make better visual 
sense to include it alongside the two columns. This looked like it was 
getting somewhere close to making sense!

Looking closer, we agreed that baseline could be interpreted as the 
'start' value where 'target' and 'actual' data is based on (hence, 
'baseline').


Throughout the day, we huddled with so many exchanging findings. Nick 
Hamlin from Global Giving shared interesting observations when he 
applied machine learning to a results dataset we supplied him with. We 
both agreed that there is still the issue of what results actually mean 
to publishers and this interpretation affects the level of granularity 
being published. Reid Porter from InterAction shared at length the 
background of historical data and how things can get lost in 
translation when very complex multi-system architectures are used 
within organisations, to then derive standardised results data from 
these systems is a close to impossible feat. Taryn Davis from 
Development Gateway shared the need for visualisations and computing 
graphs from results data that could be viewed on an ag specific 
dashboard. We all agreed that numerical values in the target and actual 
elements were best to achieve aggregation than having text in there as 
well.

We prodded further and found that baseline years were usually in 
alignment with period-start years but also that at times, publishers 
were publishing more than one period within an indicator. In terms of 
hierarchy, baseline data sits outside the period element which means 
multiple periods share just the one baseline.

Visualising this as a three column layout will be tricky so we've 
duplicated the baseline element into each period element, after the 
period-start and period-end dates. This meant the 3 columns could be 
used to compare values within the period element and visually, that 
made sense.

*Fig. 4 - Next iteration of results data with 3 columns for comparison*

We've attached further visual feedback to the actual elements; green if 
the actual value is equals to or more than the target value and 
off-yellow for actual values that are less than the target value. The 
actual box remains neutral blue if value data is missing or incorrect; 
ie. text is published instead of actual numbers.

We've also added a small indicator to show if the period data is still 
ongoing or has ended. This is represented by a 'progress bar' timeline 
underneath the period dates.

You can view this particular example activity on d-portal <a 
href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?publisher=NL-KVK-41160054#view=act&aid=NL-KVK-41160054-109805">here</a>.

**Results data with indicators and values are now live on d-portal** and 
further iterations will continue as we get a better understanding of 
how to present the data for use.

Many thanks to the organisers of the workshop and everyone who came up 
to us to share knowledge, it was humbling and eye-opening to see so 
many dedicated people working together towards the same goal with so 
much enthusiasm. We look forward to following the progress of all the 
resulting projects and outcomes of this workshop.
